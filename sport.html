			<p>My favorite sport is actually an eSport, as in competitive video games.  My favorite eSport to watch is League of Legends and my favorite team is Team Solo Mid.  As with any other regular sport, competitive League of Legends matches take place on a weekly basis.  North America competes on Saturdays and Sundays, whereas Europe plays on Thursdays and Fridays.  The League of Legends season begins in January with the Spring Spilt.  Finals for the Spring Spilt take place in May with the top team from each region competing in the Mid Season Invitational.  After MSI, there is a couple week break before the Summer Spilt begins.  This spilt lasts until August where the top 3 teams from each region move on to compete at Worlds.  Worlds spans the course of several weeks beginning with group stages and culminating in the final showdown for the Summoner's Cup.  Someday I hope to watch a match in person or even go to Worlds to spectate!</p>
