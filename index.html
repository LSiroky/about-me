			<h1>About Me.</h1>
			<p>Hello. I am Laura Siroky, as I'm sure you figured out by the title of this page.  I am 33 years old and live in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  This page will tell you all about me, including a few of my favorite things.  I love to create things through all different types of artistic medias, read, and play video games.  I have two cats named Kira and Loki and they are both incredibly adorable.  I work at Starbucks and have a fiance name Trevor, who also works at Starbucks but at a different store.  I currently attend Kirkwood Community College and am in the Graphic Communications Tech program.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Graphic Designer.</b> I initially began my Kirkwood career working towards a general associates degree. Eventually, I decided to enter the Interior Design program and was in that for a year before I realized my true calling.  While working with the digital rendering programs, such as Revit and Sketch Up, I realized that I enjoyed working in digital mediums. Thus, I switched to Graphic Communications.  I hope to some day work for a video game company creating concept designs, illustrations, or other aspects of the visual design process.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Gamer.</b> I think it is my love of video games that helped draw me to the graphics industry.  The first game that I can remember playing as a child was Pokemon Blue Version.  Eventually, I progressed to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Gauntlet Legends, Goldeneye, Mario Kart.  About 5 years ago, my fiance introduced me to the world of online gaming with The World of Warcraft.  My current favorite game is League of Legends.  I Love both playing and watching professional matchs of League of Legends.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Coffee Master.</b> I worked at Starbucks Coffee for 15 years.  Starbucks shaped my life in so many ways and been a constant in my life as a searched for my eventual career.  At one point, I thought Starbucks might be the answer to the grand question of "what should I do with my life?". Alas, the life of a retail manager is not for me.  In my years there, went through extra training to become a certified coffee master.  A title granted only to a select few and signified by a black apron.  Most recently I have been working at Toyota Financial Services as first a Customer Service Representative and more recently a Resolution Specialist. My time at Toyota has proven my ability to learn new systems and skill sets quickly as it only took me 6 months to be moved to the Resolution Specialist role.</p>
