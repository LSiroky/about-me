			<p>I found it very hard to come up with a list of just 5 movies.  I like so many it is hard to single out just a few.  For my number one, I chose Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.  In truth I love all of the Harry Potter movies and if could lump them all together for the number one spot I would.  I chose the final installment of the series because as you might guess, it is the culmination and end to every event taken that has taken place throughout the rest of the movies.  Book seven is my favorite book so it only makes sense that movie seven would also be my favorite.  Book four is my second favorite and that is why movie 4 is also in this list.</p>
